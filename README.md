# PYGROUND

💚💚💚
Playground for your code. Many times we create test 🧪 files to remember small feature or test our hypothesis 🧑‍🔬 but those files remain in our project even when we do not need them😤.This extension creates temporary folder named pyground_temp. You can create your temp files in that folder. When you will clode your window it will autmatically clean that folder for you .
